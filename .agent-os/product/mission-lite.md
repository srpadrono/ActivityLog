# Product Mission (Lite)

ActivityLog is a mobile time-tracking app that helps knowledge workers, engineers, and managers capture daily activity time with one tap by providing auto-switching timers, organized activity groups, and clear day/week/month summaries.

ActivityLog serves ICs and managers who need accurate, low-friction time capture mapped to their real workflows. Unlike generic timers, it combines one-tap auto-switching with opinionated activity grouping and on-device analytics, so weekly reporting is fast, consistent, and privacy-first.
