# 2025-09-13 Recap: One‑Tap Auto‑Switch Timers

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-13-one-tap-auto-switch-timers/spec.md.

## Recap

We implemented the core one‑tap timing flow with zero‑gap auto‑switching and second‑tap stop, added a 10s accidental‑tap guard, enforced non‑overlap at the insertion layer, and introduced basic persistence to restore a running activity across sessions. The Activities view now triggers light haptics on start/switch and a success notification on stop, and it always shows a persistent “Now Running” indicator.

- Zero‑gap switch and second‑tap stop in `ActivityTimerController`
- 10s short‑entry suppression on stop and switch
- Non‑overlap insertion API with boundary equality allowed
- Running‑state persistence via `UserDefaults` (MVP) and restoration on launch
- Haptic feedback on start/switch/stop and persistent “Now Running” UI
- Unit tests for guard, insertion rules, and persistence behavior

Known limitations and follow‑ups:
- Full Core Data model and edit/update validation are not wired yet
- UI and full test suite execution require Xcode; cannot run in this environment

## Context

Implement one-tap timers with zero-gap auto-switching and second-tap stop, enforcing non-overlapping entries at the data layer. Provide haptic and visual confirmations on transitions and keep timers running across background/termination with Core Data persistence. Ignore accidental taps under 10 seconds by discarding short entries unless extended.
