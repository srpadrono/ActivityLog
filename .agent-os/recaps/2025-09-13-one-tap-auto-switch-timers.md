# 2025-09-13 Recap: One-Tap Auto-Switch Timers

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-13-one-tap-auto-switch-timers/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the core one-tap timer behavior: starting a timer with a single tap, zero-gap auto-switching when tapping a different activity, and immediate stop on a second tap of the same activity. Added a lightweight `ActivityTimerController` with deterministic tests and wired basic UI state in `ContentView` to reflect running vs idle.

- ActivityTimerController: start, stop, and zero-gap switch with a single timestamp
- Deterministic unit tests for start/switch/stop and UI-facing helpers
- Simple activities UI tiles show running/idle state and allow tap-to-toggle
- Tasks.md updated to reflect completed subtasks for Parent Task 1

## Context

Implement one-tap timers with zero-gap auto-switching and second-tap stop, enforcing non-overlapping entries at the data layer. Provide haptic and visual confirmations on transitions and keep timers running across background/termination with Core Data persistence. Ignore accidental taps under 10 seconds by discarding short entries unless extended.
