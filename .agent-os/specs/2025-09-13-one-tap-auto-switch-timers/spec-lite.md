# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement one-tap timers with zero-gap auto-switching and second-tap stop, enforcing non-overlapping entries at the data layer. Provide haptic and visual confirmations on transitions and keep timers running across background/termination with Core Data persistence. Ignore accidental taps under 10 seconds by discarding short entries unless extended.
